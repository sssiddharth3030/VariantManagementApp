# FAST API Microservice for UI5 Variant Management
## About the Project

This is a demonstration of UI5 Freestyle Screen View with Variant Management handled via Python FASTAPI backend .

The logic to manage & store variant's in DB are implemented as a Python microservice , and designed to be useable by multiple object .

The UI5 is built as a quick example to demonstrate the backend functionality , complete with create, read, save, saveas, delete, rename, reload functionality .

### Built With

* Python
* FAST API
* Pydantic
* TinyDB
* Javascript
* UI5

  * To run the UI5 frotend instance .

### Prerequisites
Please ensure Python , PIP , Nodejs & NPM are installed in your system .

### Initialization - Python

* TINY DB

    TinyDB is a serverless nosql database with simple API , allowing document store . 
This is stuiable for low traffic project where most of user actions are read .

    For scalabilty, concurrency & advanced features , please use Redis or Valkey . esp. in case of high write traffic .

    The data is stored in variant.json file under two db: header & data .
